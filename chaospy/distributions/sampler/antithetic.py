Create `antithetic variates`_ from variables on the unit hyper-cube.

In statistics, the antithetic variates method is a variance reduction technique
used in Monte Carlo methods. Considering that the error reduction in the
simulated signal (using Monte Carlo methods) has a square root convergence,
a very large number of sample paths is required to obtain an accurate result.
The antithetic variates method reduces the variance of the simulation results.

Antithetic variate can be accessed as a flag ``antithetic`` in the method
``Distribution.sample`` It can either be set to ``True``, for activation, or as an
array of boolean values, which implies it will be used as the flag ``axes`` in
the examples below.

Example usage
-------------

Creating antithetic variates can be done directly from each distribution by
using the ``antithetic`` flag::

    >>> distribution = chaospy.Uniform(0, 1)
    >>> samples = distribution.sample(6, antithetic=True)

Antithetic variates contains compliment values of itself::

    >>> samples.round(4)
    array([0.6536, 0.3464, 0.115 , 0.885 , 0.9503, 0.0497])
    >>> 1-samples.round(4)
    array([0.3464, 0.6536, 0.885 , 0.115 , 0.0497, 0.9503])

Antithetic variates can also be used in multiple dimensions::

    >>> distribution = chaospy.Iid(chaospy.Uniform(0, 1), 2)
    >>> samples = distribution.sample(6, antithetic=True)
    >>> samples.round(4)
    array([[0.8725, 0.1275, 0.8725, 0.1275, 0.2123, 0.7877],
           [0.3972, 0.3972, 0.6028, 0.6028, 0.2331, 0.2331]])
    >>> 1-samples.round(4)
    array([[0.1275, 0.8725, 0.1275, 0.8725, 0.7877, 0.2123],
           [0.6028, 0.6028, 0.3972, 0.3972, 0.7669, 0.7669]])

Lastly, it is also possible to select which axes should be included when
applying the variate by passing a bool array. For axes that are "false", the
value is frozen in place::

    >>> samples = distribution.sample(6, antithetic=[True, False])
    >>> samples.round(4)
    array([[0.2071, 0.7929, 0.7425, 0.2575, 0.3922, 0.6078],
           [0.1823, 0.1823, 0.7435, 0.7435, 0.0696, 0.0696]])
    >>> 1-samples.round(4)
    array([[0.7929, 0.2071, 0.2575, 0.7425, 0.6078, 0.3922],
           [0.8177, 0.8177, 0.2565, 0.2565, 0.9304, 0.9304]])
    >>> samples = distribution.sample(6, antithetic=[False, True])
    >>> samples.round(4)
    array([[0.8853, 0.8853, 0.9526, 0.9526, 0.9311, 0.9311],
           [0.4154, 0.5846, 0.029 , 0.971 , 0.982 , 0.018 ]])
    >>> 1-samples.round(4)
    array([[0.1147, 0.1147, 0.0474, 0.0474, 0.0689, 0.0689],
           [0.5846, 0.4154, 0.971 , 0.029 , 0.018 , 0.982 ]])
