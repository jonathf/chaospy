    Create orthogonal polynomial expansion.

    This function is a frontend wrapper for the three methods for creating
    orthogonal polynomials:

    ---------------------   ---------------------------------------------------
    Method                  Description
    =====================   ===================================================
    three_terms_recursion   Three terms recurrence coefficients gnerated using
                            Stieltjes and Golub-Welsch method. The most stable
                            of the methods, but do not work on dependent
                            distributions.
    ---------------------   ---------------------------------------------------
    gram_schmidt            Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method applied on
                            polynomial expansions. Know for being numerically
                            unstable.
    ---------------------   ---------------------------------------------------
    cholesky                Orthogonalization through decorrelation of
                            the covariance matrix. Uses Gill-King's Cholesky
                            decomposition method for higher numerical
                            stability. Still not scalable to high number of
                            dimensions.
    ---------------------   ---------------------------------------------------

    Args:
        order (int):
            Order of polynomial expansion.
        dist (Dist):
            Distribution space where polynomials are orthogonal. If the method
            ``dist._ttr`` exists, it will be used.
        rule (str):
            The orthogonalization method used.
        normed (bool):
            If True orthonormal polynomials will be used.
        sort (str):
            Polynomial sorting. Same as in basis.
        retall (bool):
            If true return numerical stabilized norms as well. Roughly the same
            as ``cp.E(orth**2, dist)``.
        cross_truncation (float):
            Use hyperbolic cross truncation scheme to reduce the number of
            terms in expansion. only include terms where the exponents ``K``
            satisfied the equation
            ``order >= sum(K**(1/cross_truncation))**cross_truncation``.

    Returns:
        (chaospy.poly.ndpoly, numpy.ndarray):
            Orthogonal polynomial expansion. norms of the orthogonal
            expansion on the form ``E(orth**2, dist)``. Calculated using
            recurrence coefficients for stability.

    Examples:
        >>> distribution = chaospy.Normal()
        >>> expansion, norms = generate_expansion(3, distribution, retall=True)
        >>> expansion
        polynomial([1.0, q0, q0**2-1.0, q0**3-3.0*q0])
        >>> norms
        array([1., 1., 2., 6.])
