    Skewness operator.

    Element by element 3rd order statistics of a distribution or polynomial.

    Args:
        poly (numpoly.ndpoly, Dist):
            Input to take skewness on.
        dist (Dist):
            Defines the space the skewness is taken on. It is ignored if
            ``poly`` is a distribution.

    Returns:
        (numpy.ndarray):
            Element for element variance along ``poly``, where
            ``skewness.shape == poly.shape``.

    Examples:
        >>> dist = chaospy.J(chaospy.Gamma(1, 1), chaospy.Normal(0, 2))
        >>> chaospy.Skew(dist)
        array([2., 0.])
