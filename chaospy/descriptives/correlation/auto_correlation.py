    Auto-correlation function.

    Args:
        poly (numpoly.ndpoly):
            Polynomial of interest. Must have ``len(poly) > N``.
        dist (Dist):
            Defines the space the correlation is taken on.
        N (int):
            The number of time steps apart included. If omitted set to

            Auto-correlation of ``poly`` with shape ``(N,)``. Note that by
            definition ``Q[0]=1``.
