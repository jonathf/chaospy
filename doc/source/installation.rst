------------

Installation should be straight forward::

Alternativly, to get the most current version, the code can be installed from
github as follows::

    git clone git@github.com:jonathf/chaospy.git
    cd chaospy
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setupy.py install

The last command might need ``sudo`` prefix, depending on your python setup.

Optional Packages

package::

    pip install scikit-learn

-------

To test the build locally::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    python setup.py test

It will run ``pytest-runner`` and execute all tests.
